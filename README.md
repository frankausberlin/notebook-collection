This is a jupyter notebook with several and I hope useful
code snippets around very interesting technologies. Optimized for google colab.

<table>

<tr><td>image search</td><td>This little snippet does a picture search with DuckDuckGo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>video snippets</td><td>youtube, stream + take picture, record video</td></tr>
<tr><td>and some more</td><td>usefull snippets to discover.</td></tr>
</table>
