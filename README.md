# notebook-collection

A small collection of notebooks around artificial intelligence.

## Snippet Pearls
This is a jupyter notebook with several and I hope useful
code snippets around very interesting technologies. Optimized for google colab.

<table>
<tr><td>command shell</td><td>A snippet that uses jQuery Terminal in code cell output.</td></tr>
<tr><td>image search</td><td>This little snippet does a picture search with DuckDuckGo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>video snippets</td><td>youtube, stream + take picture, record video</td></tr>
<tr><td>and some more</td><td>usefull snippets to discover.</td></tr>
</table>


## The Backpropagation Notebook

I explain myself the backpropagation of errors - with implementation, some fancy drawings and understandable math.


## The OpenAI Notebook

* This notebook is my [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) for the OpenAI stuff and you should use it with google colab.
* It contains accompanying material for the DLAI [prompt engineering course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) - currently free (06/05/2023) for a limited time.
* And some tools using the API.
