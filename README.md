# notebook-collection

A small collection of notebooks around artificial intelligence.

## SnippetPearls
This is a jupyter notebook with several and I hope useful
code snippets around very interesting technologies. Optimized for google colab.

<table>
<tr><td>command shell</td><td>A snippet that uses jQuery Terminal in code cell output.</td></tr>
<tr><td>image search</td><td>This little snippet does a picture search with DuckDuckGo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>local runtime</td><td>A small guide to set up a local runtime.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cuda</td><td>A cell for tensorflow, pytorch and numba to test the gpu.</td></tr>
<tr><td>docker</td><td>A snippet showing how to build cuda into docker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ml environment</td><td>The mamba-create for a (on my machine) working environment with jupyter etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>gdrive hosting</td><td>Description how to host an image on gdrive and use it in notebook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>video snippets</td><td>youtube, stream + take picture, record video</td></tr>
<tr><td>and some more</td><td>usefull snippets to discover.</td></tr>
</table>

## NeuralNetworkNotebook

This is a little cheat sheet to describe the essence of what is called a (**feed forward**) **neural network**.

To understand you have to know some basic concepts which you can find around a bunch of keywords - these are the most important: 

<table width='600'>
<tr><td><p><b>Perceptron<br><br>Parameter</td><td><p><b>Data<br><br>Batches</td><td><p><b>Layer<br><br>Model</td><td><p><b>Training<br><br>Optimizer</td><td><p><b>Loss<br><br>Metric</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=5><font size='-5'>In the following, further <b>keywords</b> are shown in bold type.</font></td></tr>
</table><br>

I use Pytorch as library. The self-made classes serves to improve understanding. These are limited to the basic functionality and are to be seen as excerpts from the library classes.

## The math notebook

It's under heavy freaky stimulating endless development status. I only added it up to play with git...
